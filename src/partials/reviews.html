              We did the Forgotten Scientist’s Lab with friends and honestly
              didn’t expect it to be this immersive. The puzzles were smart, the
              atmosphere was spot on, and the time flew by way too fast.

              The City Bank Heist was intense in the best way possible. .
              Perfect team-building activity — we actually worked together
              instead of arguing.

              The Curse of the Old Villa was beautifully designed and genuinely
              creepy at times. Not too scary, but very atmospheric. A couple of
              puzzles were tricky, but the staff helped at the moment.

              We booked this for a birthday and it was the best decision. The
              staff was super friendly, the room was immersive, and the
              post-game photos were a nice touch. Such a memorable experience!

              First escape room experience ever — and now I’m hooked. Everything
              was well explained, the game flow made sense, and the set design
              felt like a movie set. Highly recommended for beginners.
